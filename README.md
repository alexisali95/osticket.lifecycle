# osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Responding and Managing User’s Tickets

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate responding, assigning and solving tickets on the osTicketing system.

## Environments and Technologies Used:

* Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
* Remote Desktop
* Internet Information Services (IIS)

## Operating Systems Used

* Windows 10 Pro (21H2)

## Ticket Lifecycle Stages

* Support Center (tickets created by clients)
* Assignment and Communication
* Addressing the Issue 
* Solving the problem

## Lifestyle Stages

### Support Center (Intake)
![1  create a new ticket](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f13c30cd-32f1-48c0-b64f-788ef1c2c6c0)
![2  create client ticket](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ec81b80-f374-43d7-b156-12e4f5c52f67)

The support ticket system allows clients to send new tickets to agents. This is a brand new lifecycle because an agent has not received the ticket yet.

### Assignment and Communication

![4  admin updates tickets](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/203303b6-d64d-4173-80ea-117730e81fa3)

Now, multiple tickets have been received and are waiting to be assigned to an agent. Once assigned, the agent’s job is to update the ticket status from “NEW” to “Work in Progress (WIP)” by responding through some form of clear communication. This response reassures the client or ticket creator that their issue is being addressed and is moving toward a solution. 

The agent follows up with the user to request more details about the issue. At this stage, the agent updates the ticket with the exact information provided to ensure the problem is accurately recorded. The agent then reassures the client that the team is officially moved to “Work in Progress” status. Now, if the client takes too long to respond, the ticket may be placed on hold or marked as pending until the necessary information is received. 

### Working the Issue

![5  login as admin to resolve ticket](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae416bf8-8480-4fef-b3dd-e7fdb3ed27ee)

After logging in the Tickets window will appear, displaying details such as the ticket number, last update, subject, submitter, priority level, and assigned agent. To begin working on a ticket, simply click on it to open it.

Once it's updated the ticket then moves to “Work in Progress” status. To ensure quality service, SLAs must be followed, as they track response times, resolution times, and whether targets are met. As agents work on the issue, they actively assess the ticket, provide a solution, and work toward resolving it.
